# SBC Background Subtraction

This project reduce the background of the HST Solar Blind Channel (SBC) Multi Anode Microchannel Array (MAMA) image.

The main sources of the background are sky background and dark current.
The sky background are scattered lights of the astronomical object. The dark current is the thermal noise of the instrument, which has a spatial pattern that the background level is higher at the center region of the image.
